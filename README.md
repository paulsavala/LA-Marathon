# LA-Marathon
Predicting LA Marathon placing using speed variation

In this analysis I use a Random Forest Regressor to predict placing in the LA Marathon for male runners. I show that placing is better determined by how their speed *varies*, as opposed to simply look at how fast the runner was at the 5k mark. In other words, variation in speed throughout the marathon is a good predictor of placing.

The techniques I use to accomplish this are maching learning algorithms, implemented in Python using Pandas with SciKit-Learn. Full code for scraping, data processing and analysis are included.
